# Checkr-Internship-Exercise
Solution to exercise provided by Checkr

I was not exactly sure on what was meant by filter by disaster so I did not 
have time to implement that particular feature. I also, as you will see, 
first misunderstood the directions and used FEMA's API for most of the 
project, but I realized my mistake and created my own. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like me to elaborate 
on any of the contents in here.
